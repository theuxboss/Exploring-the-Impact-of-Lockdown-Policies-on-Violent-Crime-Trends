# Exploring-the-Impact-of-Lockdown-Policies-on-Violent-Crime-Trends

### Introduction 

In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, governments worldwide, including the United Kingdom, implemented strict measures such as lockdowns to contain the virus. From March 2020 to May 2021, the UK enforced various lockdown policies that aimed to limit movement and social interactions, which affected different aspects of society, including crime rates.

### Background 

The UK government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic involved nationwide lockdowns and localized restrictions in areas with high infection rates. A 2023 study conducted by Neanidis & Rana showed that these measures were effective in controlling the spread of the virus. However, their impact on other social phenomena, such as violent crime, remains a subject of inquiry.

### Objectives 

This case study aims to analyze trends in violent crime in the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2021 and investigate the potential influence of lockdown policies on these trends.

### Methodology 

We will use official crime statistics and government reports to examine the incidence of violent crimes, including violence and sexual offences, during the specified timeframe. We will employ statistical methods, such as trend analysis and regression modeling, to assess any discernible patterns or correlations between lockdown periods and changes in violent crime levels.
